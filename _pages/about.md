* Designed and implemented an extrinsic calibration algorithm for little-overlapping dual-camera systems
* Developed and maintained [Orbbec ROS package](https://github.com/orbbec/ros_astra_camera)

Firmware Engineer at [Actions Microelectronics](https://www.actions-micro.com/about.php?l=en) <font color="#888888" size="4">[Dec 2017 - March 2018]</font>
* Devoloped wifi display functions of [EZCast](https://www.iezvu.com).

Software Engineer at [DMP Electronics](http://www.compactpc.com.tw/about_us.aspx) <font color="#888888" size="4">[Oct 2014 - Aug 2014]</font>
* [86Duino Motion Editor](https://github.com/Sayter99/86ME): Developed a frame-based motion editor for multi-functional robots.
  * <font size="4">Supported various input devices, such as the keyboard, WiFi, Ethernet, Bluetooth, and PS2 joystick, for controlling robots.</font>
  * <font size="4">Integrated inertial measurement units (IMU) that can help robots resist shocks and vibrations</font>
  * <font size="4">Implemented approaches to generate cubic splines for smoothing the trajectory of servo motors</font>
  * <font size="4">Designed and implemented the two-layer motion blending feature for creating more flexible motions</font>
  * <font size="4">Implemented templates to automatically generate firmware that replaces manual coding work</font>
  * <font size="4">Integrated firmware with Scratch 2.0 that users can program their robots with graphical blocks</font>
  * <font size="4">Applied to two 3D-printable robots, including a hexapod, 86Hexapod, and a biped robot</font>

* 86Duino SDK
  * [Linux SDK](https://github.com/roboard/86Duino_Linux_SDK):<font size="4"> allow users to manipulate 86Duino I/Os in Linux environment</font>
  * [libMRAA Porting](https://github.com/Sayter99/mraa):<font size="4"> allow users to manipulate I/Os with C/C++, Java, Python or JavaScript</font>
  * [AIServo86](https://github.com/roboard/86Duino/tree/master/hardware/86duino/x86/libraries/AIServo86):<font size="4"> a library of controlling smart actuators such as Dynamixel servos</font>

* Robots
  * <font size="4">Designed and implemented firmware of 3D-printable robots including a hexapod and a humanoid robot</font>
  * <font size="4">Built internal packages to integrate ROS with the 86Duino ecosystem</font>

## Education
[University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/)
* Master in Computer Science, GPA 4.00/4.00 <font color="#888888" size="4">[2018 - 2020]</font>
  * Human Interruption Detection in HRC
    * <font size="4">Developed an approach to allow robots to detect users’ intention to interrupt a robot mid-execution based on visual and audio signals. The goal is to improve interactivity in Human-Robot Collaboration tasks.</font>
      * <font size="4">Implemented Dynamic Safety Margin controller on Sawyer based on MoveIt! and KDL</font>
      * <font size="4">Developed a system to detect the beginning of interruptions using OpenFace</font>
  * 1/10-scale Mini Race Car
    * <font size="4">Designed and developed an autonomous system integrating Rock64, RealSense D435i, and Pololu controller.</font>
      * <font size="4">Implemented a remote control and debugging package to speed up development</font>
      * <font size="4">Implemented a state machine using depth data to achieve the fastest record in class to complete a route</font>
      * <font size="4">Integrated ORB Slam with RealSense to create sparse map while moving</font>
  * [HIRO-group](https://hiro-group.ronc.one/) Research Assistant
    * <font size="4">Developed infrastructures including motion control interfaces, sensor integration, and simulation</font>

[National Chiao Tung University](http://www.nctu.edu.tw)
